# Hypergraph-Stats
A small project with the purpose of obtaining and cataloging statistics from biological interactomes that have been converted into hypergraphs.


Uncomment the stuff at the bottom of parseCount.py and run it on any of the bioinf machines to get a display about hyperedges.

Run (python3) fragCount.py on any of the bioinf machines to get a (rough) display about connectivity.
